# Personal-Site Project
This project is going to be a work-in-progress so I can better learn how to use git/github

# What this project is currently using
Currently I am using Github Desktop to create the repo & push changes, my IDE is Visual Studio Code and
I am still troubleshooting how to push changes directly FROM the IDE, so for now Github Desktop works best for me.

Currently this site is using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I have plans to re-work the site to use React.js down the road, however a section below talks about why I chose not to go down this route from the start.

# About 
This is my portfolio site which I am putting up on github for both people who are just curious and want to see how I did something, as well as prospective employers who want to see how I went about coding something from scratch, my syntax, etc.

Note: I try NOT to use jQuery whenever possible in my projects. Yes I know it speeds things up but I am of the belief you should learn the language a library is based on before you try to learn the library or framework, and the resource penalty that comes with jQuery when you start adding a lot of effects, or the downside of having to import an entire library when it's only used in 1 or 2 places, wasn't really worth it. I will have seperate jQuery repos that demonstrate my ability to use it if it's needed though so please look forward to it! [:

This is a project I'd like to maintain and continue so expect updates to come!

### Edit : 6/6/18 
 - Complete rework of responsiveness, for now only one media query, additional queries to come later
 - ### Stopped using react for now
    - My reason for this is as I am not as proficient as I'd like to be in React at the moment, I wanted to get a working layout up FIRST and then over time refactor it to use react, instead of just piling things ontop without really seeing the bigger picture or understanding how it worked. 
    **You can still find the original react code in the 'FirstProject' folder.**
    
 - Inclusion of app.js which features a nav-bar effect that changes the background-color and color properties 
   to be more readable as the user scrolls into a darker section of the background-image.
 - Note, the background image isn't mine, it's just a placehholder I'm using while I get something more personal!
    - expect updates to CSS colors to match the colour scheme of whatever image I DO decide to use in the end :]

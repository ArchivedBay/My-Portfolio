# Personal-Site Project
This project is going to be a work-in-progress so I can better learn how to use git/github, as well as learn React.js

# What this project is currently using
Currently I am using Github Desktop to create the repo & push changes, my IDE is Visual Studio Code and
I am still troubleshooting how to push changes directly FROM the IDE, so for now Github Desktop works best for me.

I am using React.js & React router to allow for a multi-page site within the context of a single HTML file,
I also realize that it might be more effecient to reduce the number of .css pages, however I am trying to give myself as much
practice importing and exporting and using the syntax, plus it helps me understand the flow of react a bit better.

# About 
This is a project I'd like to maintain and continue, perhaps using it as a foundation for my personal site once I've learned
more; as such there are only a few pages at the moment each with simple placeholder text since my focus at the moment is not
the content or styling, but the functionality and structure. Updates to come!
